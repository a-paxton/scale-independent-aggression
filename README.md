# Code for "Scale-independent aggression" (Blau & Paxton, in press, *Complexity*)

This repo contains the code for the analyses presented in our article, 
"Scale-independent aggression" (Blau & Paxton, in press, *Complexity*). 
It is intended to accompany our OSF project (https://osf.io/8qcya/).

## Related materials

Data for the analyses (as accepted by *Complexity*) can be found at our OSF
project: https://osf.io/8qcya/.

## Notes on running and viewing

For best viewing in a browser, we recommend selecting the `.md` files, rather 
than similarly named `.Rmd` files. Analyses should be run using the `.Rmd` 
file of the same names.

For those unfamiliar with R markdown, we recommend taking a look at 
[RStudio's introduction to R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) 
before attempting to run the `.Rmd` file. We recommend downloading
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) first, if you do not already have 
it installed on your machine.
